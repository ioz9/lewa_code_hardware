The build requires that certain libraries be copied into this folder from the
CodeSourcery ARM toolchain.

This folder can be used for copying certain system libraries required for
building Syslink/Bridge.

The following commands are provided for reference. Copy the desired libraries
from the toolchain into this directory. ARM 2008Q3 toolchain is assumed to be
installed in /data/omapts/linux/arm-tc/arm-2008q3. Please adjust the path in the
below commands accordingly.

Current example shows the libpthread.so and librt.so soft links to be created in 
this folder. They can be created in target/lib folder as well.

ln -s ../../lib/libpthread.so.0 libpthread.so
ln -s ../../lib/librt.so.1 librt.so

All the files in this folder need to be copied to the target root file system's
/usr/lib folder for using with Syslink/Bridge.
