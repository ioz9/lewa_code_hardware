This folder has the user-space Syslink & Bridge library files after building the
respective sources. 

The build requires that certain libraries be copied into this folder from the 
CodeSourcery ARM toolchain.

The following commands are provided for reference. Copy the desired libraries
from the toolchain into this directory. ARM 2008Q3 toolchain is assumed to be 
installed in /data/omapts/linux/arm-tc/arm-2008q3. Please adjust the path in the
below commands accordingly.

cp -vlf /data/omapts/linux/arm-tc/arm-2008q3/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/libc/lib/libpthread*.* ./
cp -vlf /data/omapts/linux/arm-tc/arm-2008q3/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/libc/lib/librt*.* ./
cp -vlf /data/omapts/linux/arm-tc/arm-2008q3/lib/gcc/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/4.3.2/libgcc.a .

libpthread.so and librt.so soft links can then be created here or in 
target/usr/lib. The links should be point to libpthread.so.0 and librt.so.1
respectively.

ln -s libpthread.so.0 libpthread.so
ln -s librt.so.1 librt.so

All the generated files and copied files need to be copied to the target root
file system's lib folder for using Syslink/Bridge.
